"""In-memory store of active game rooms.

A single `GameStore` instance holds every room in a dict. State lives only in
RAM: it is lost on server restart, which is acceptable for short-lived party
games. Because it is in-memory, the backend must run as a SINGLE instance
(no horizontal scaling) — replicas would not share this dict.

The store is capped at `MAX_ROOMS`. Room creation is unauthenticated and this
process holds every room in RAM, so without a ceiling a loop of POST /rooms
grows it until the platform kills the container — taking every live game with
it. The 6h idle sweep is far too slow to be the answer to that on its own.

Rooms are evicted after `ROOM_TTL_SECONDS` of inactivity. The sweep is lazy —
it runs on room create/lookup rather than on a background task — because the
only thing that grows the store is a request, so there is nothing to clean up
while the process is idle. `time_fn` and `on_evict` are injected the way
`timer.py` injects its clock, so tests run instantly and without touching disk.
