#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs integration_test/two_device_test.dart on two simulators at once, so the
# app is actually tested against another copy of itself.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run-two-device-test.sh            # boots and uses the defaults
#
# The room is created here rather than by one of the devices: there is no way
# for the first device to tell the second which code it drew, so the code is
# handed to both as a --dart-define.
#
# The two runs are staggered. Both build into build/ios, and two concurrent
# builds race while copying Flutter.framework — the same failure the local
# multiplayer script works around. Starting the second run once the first has
# finished building makes its build a cache hit.
